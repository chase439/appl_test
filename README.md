# Code Challenges
My challenges and personal solutions.

### Code Challenge Platforms
- https://www.getpy.com - you can find jobs on here too.
- https://medium.com/coderbyte/the-5-best-platforms-screening-recruiting-programmers-b342a7371946
- https://coderpad.io - 25 languages, someone else could watch the screen while you code.
- "Hackerrank and Codility have successfully created coding challenges that are used by thousands of companies to streamline their screening processes. Lytmus solves a similar problem by simplifying project-based assessment instead of coding challenges. Py is bringing its own unique approach to both challenges and project-based screening that puts candidates first."
